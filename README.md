# Hello there!

I'm Stefano, a dedicated Software Developer üíª, proudly based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada üçÅ. My passion for technology drives me to create impactful solutions that enhance people's lives.

<br>

## About Me

üéì **Education:** I recently graduated from the [Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology (MITT)](https://mitt.ca/) with a focus on software development. My time at MITT equipped me with a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, and I‚Äôm excited to apply these skills in the professional world.

üîß **Professional Experience:** I recently completed an internship at Bit Space Development, where I was actively involved in a cutting-edge project. I worked with a diverse tech stack including React TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, Three.js, React-Three/Fiber, MySQL, phpMyAdmin, Docker, and Next.js. This experience allowed me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, collaborate with a talented team, and contribute meaningfully to the development process.

üöÄ **Side Projects:** Beyond my formal education and internship, I‚Äôm continuing to collaborate with [IleanaEcheverria](https://github.com/IleanaEcheverria) and [bulga138](https://github.com/bulga138) on a mobile app project. This project is pushing my abilities further into full-stack development, with a strong focus on modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React Native. Each project I undertake is a step closer to my goal of becoming a well-rounded full-stack web developer.

üéí **Ongoing Learning:** I‚Äôm committed to continuous learning, whether it‚Äôs through mastering new technologies, refining my coding practices, or engaging with the development community. Staying up-to-date in this rapidly evolving field is a priority for me as I move forward in my career.

üåç **Beyond Coding:** When I‚Äôm not coding, I love to explore new places, capturing the world through my lens as an avid traveler and photographer. My passion for movies and videography complements my creative side, adding a unique perspective to my approach in tech.
